# A/B Testing Simulator - karpov.courses
This repository holds my materials and the full outline of the **A/B Testing Simulator from karpov.courses**. 
This simulator includes a large number of theoretical and practical tasks, including hypothesis formulation, experiment design and design verification, 1st and 2nd type error control, variance reduction techniques, etc.

**karpov.courses** is one of the leading Russian online schools. At the moment, the school offers a large number of courses and simulators in data professions (data and product analytics, data engineering, machine learning, etc.), and the school itself is a direct competitor of Yandex.Praktikum.

## Course Contents
1. Basics of statistics
2. Hypothesis testing
3. MDE, sample size, designing experiments
4. Design testing, type I and II errors controlling
5. Confidence intervals
6. Bootstrap
7. Variance reduction techniques: removing outliers, stratification, CUPED
8. Metrics selection
9. Sequential testing
10. Split system
11. User metrics, ratio-metrics, and linearization

## Tech Stack
1. Python with libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)
2. Jupyter Lab, VSCode

## Results
The course was 100% successfully completed. During the course, I not only improved my understanding of A/B testing and statistical concepts and methods, but also practiced applying them using Python. At the end of the course I received a certificate, which can also be found in this repository.
